## Tasks

### 1. Enable Microphone Access
- [ ] Request microphone permissions when extension is activated
- [ ] Show clear explanation of why microphone is needed
- [ ] Handle permission denial gracefully with instructions
- [ ] Test microphone detection on Microsoft Edge
- [ ] Provide visual indicator when microphone is active

### 2. Voice Command Recognition
- [ ] Implement speech-to-text using Web Speech API
- [ ] Set up continuous listening mode
- [ ] Create command dictionary for recognized phrases:
  - [ ] Navigation: "scroll up", "scroll down", "go back"
  - [ ] Reading: "read page", "stop reading", "pause", "resume"
  - [ ] Links: "list links", "open link [number/name]"
  - [ ] Control: "help", "stop", "repeat"
  - [ ] Zoom: "zoom in", "zoom out", "reset zoom"
- [ ] Normalize variations (e.g., "go down" = "scroll down")
- [ ] Handle background noise and unclear speech

### 3. Command Confirmation Feedback
- [ ] Provide brief audio confirmation when command is recognized
  - [ ] Play subtle sound effect (beep or chime)
  - [ ] Or speak brief confirmation: "Scrolling down", "Opening link"
- [ ] Visual indicator showing recognized command (for debugging)
- [ ] Keep confirmations under 3 words for efficiency
- [ ] Test that confirmations don't interrupt user

### 4. Wake Word (Optional)
- [ ] Detect activation phrase "Hey Hoda" or "Hoda"
- [ ] Only listen for commands after wake word
- [ ] Visual/audio cue when assistant is ready
- [ ] Allow users to toggle wake word on/off in settings
- [ ] Timeout after 5 seconds of no command

### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Handle unclear speech: "I didn't catch that. Please repeat."
- [ ] Handle unknown commands: "I don't know that command. Say 'help' for options."
- [ ] Handle microphone issues: "Microphone not detected. Please check connection."
- [ ] Provide clear recovery steps for all errors
- [ ] Log errors for debugging

### 6. Command Processing System
- [ ] Build system to route commands to appropriate features
- [ ] Queue commands for sequential processing
- [ ] Prevent command conflicts (e.g., multiple commands at once)
- [ ] Allow interruption of current action with "stop"

### 7. Testing & Accuracy
- [ ] Test 20+ common voice commands
- [ ] Test with different accents and speaking speeds
- [ ] Test in quiet and noisy environments
- [ ] Test with different microphone qualities
- [ ] Measure recognition accuracy (target: >80%)
- [ ] Document any limitations or edge cases

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can activate extension and grant microphone access
- [ ] Extension recognizes common voice commands with >80% accuracy
- [ ] User receives immediate feedback when command is recognized
- [ ] Unclear commands trigger helpful error messages with recovery steps
- [ ] System works reliably in Microsoft Edge
- [ ] User can control extension entirely hands-free
