    <h2 id="section1">Section 1: Introduction to Voice Page Reading</h2>

    <p>
      Voice page reading is a revolutionary feature that enables visually impaired users
      to consume web content through spoken narration. This technology transforms the
      browsing experience by reading webpage content aloud, allowing users to listen
      rather than read.
    </p>

    <p>
      The implementation uses intelligent content extraction to identify the main readable
      content on a page while filtering out advertisements, navigation menus, sidebars,
      and other non-essential elements. This ensures that users hear only the most
      relevant information.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Accessibility is not just about compliance; it's about creating equal opportunities
      for everyone to access and enjoy digital content." - Accessibility Advocate
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>

    <p>
      Voice page reading offers several advantages for users with visual impairments or
      reading difficulties:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hands-free content consumption while multitasking</li>
      <li>Reduced eye strain from prolonged screen time</li>
      <li>Better comprehension through auditory learning</li>
      <li>Accessibility for users with dyslexia or other reading challenges</li>
      <li>Convenient content consumption during commutes or exercise</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="sidebar">
      <strong>Did You Know?</strong>
      <p>
        Over 2.2 billion people worldwide have some form of visual impairment.
        Voice technology makes the web accessible to millions who might otherwise
        struggle with traditional text-based content.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="section2">Section 2: How It Works</h2>

    <p>
      The voice page reading system consists of three main components working together
      seamlessly: content extraction, reading state management, and text-to-speech synthesis.
    </p>

    <h3>Content Extraction</h3>

    <p>
      The content extraction engine analyzes the page structure using semantic HTML elements
      like article, main, and section tags. It identifies the primary content container
      and extracts text blocks while excluding navigation, advertisements, and other
      non-content elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The extractor uses sophisticated algorithms to determine which elements contain
      meaningful content. It considers factors like text length, element positioning,
      and semantic markup to make intelligent decisions about what should be read aloud.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading State Management</h3>

    <p>
      A dedicated state manager tracks the current reading position, allowing users to
      pause and resume reading at any point. It maintains a queue of content blocks
      and provides navigation capabilities to move between paragraphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The state manager also handles visual feedback by highlighting the currently
      reading paragraph, helping users with partial vision follow along with the narration.
    </p>

    <div class="ad">
      🚫 ADVERTISEMENT - This should not be read aloud
    </div>

    <h3>Text-to-Speech Synthesis</h3>

    <p>
      The system uses the Web Speech API's text-to-speech capabilities to convert
      extracted text into natural-sounding speech. Users can customize voice settings
      including rate, pitch, and voice selection to match their preferences.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section3">Section 3: Navigation and Control</h2>

    <p>
      Voice page reading provides comprehensive navigation controls that give users
      full control over their listening experience. All commands are voice-activated,
      maintaining hands-free operation.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Controls</h3>

    <p>
      Users can start reading with the "read page" command, which begins narration
      from the top of the page. The "pause" command temporarily stops reading while
      maintaining the current position, and "resume" continues from where it left off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "stop reading" command halts narration completely and resets the reading
      position. Users can also say "read from here" to start reading from their
      current scroll position on the page.
    </p>

    <h3>Paragraph Navigation</h3>

    <p>
      Advanced navigation features allow users to skip between paragraphs using
      "next paragraph" and "previous paragraph" commands. This is particularly
      useful for quickly scanning through content or re-listening to specific sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      The navigation system intelligently handles different content types including
      headings, lists, blockquotes, and tables. Each element is announced appropriately
      to provide context about the page structure.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "The best technology is invisible - it just works when you need it."
      - Technology Philosopher
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Visual Feedback</h3>

    <p>
      For users with partial vision, the system provides visual indicators showing
      which paragraph is currently being read. A subtle highlight with a yellow
      background and border appears on the active paragraph, scrolling automatically
      to keep it in view.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Voice page reading represents a significant step forward in web accessibility.
      By combining intelligent content extraction, state management, and natural
      text-to-speech synthesis, it creates a seamless listening experience for
      users who benefit from audio content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The implementation adheres to accessibility best practices and provides an
      intuitive interface through voice commands. This ensures that users can
      navigate and consume web content with the same ease and efficiency as
      visual browsing.
    </p>

    <p>
      As web technology continues to evolve, features like voice page reading
      will become increasingly important for creating truly inclusive digital
      experiences. The goal is not just compliance with accessibility standards,
      but genuinely empowering all users to access information independently.
